\subsection*{Implementing the Bandit Algorithm}

\item \points{2a}

For this assignment we will be using the Disjoint Linear Upper Confidence Bound (LinUCB) algorithm from \cite{li2010contextual}. 
The hints provided in \texttt{submission.py} should help you with this.
You have already implemented this in the previous problem but you will have to now fill the code in the 
\texttt{add\_arm\_params()} method to account for the fact that the number of arms could keep increasing now.
